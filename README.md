# AgileTrader

## Description

AgileTrader is a Python-based algorithmic trading framework designed for rapid prototyping and deployment of trading strategies. It provides a modular architecture that allows users to easily integrate different data sources, trading algorithms, and risk management modules. The framework prioritizes flexibility and extensibility, enabling both novice and experienced traders to quickly iterate on their strategies and adapt to changing market conditions. AgileTrader aims to abstract away the complexities of market data handling, order execution, and backtesting, allowing users to focus on the core logic of their trading algorithms. It is built with performance and scalability in mind, making it suitable for both individual traders and small to medium-sized trading firms.

## Features

*   **Modular Architecture:** The framework is built using a modular design, allowing users to easily swap out components like data feeds, trading algorithms, and risk management modules. This promotes code reusability and simplifies the process of testing and debugging individual components.
*   **Backtesting Engine:** A robust backtesting engine allows users to evaluate the performance of their trading strategies using historical data. The engine supports various backtesting methodologies, including walk-forward analysis and parameter optimization.
*   **Real-time Data Integration:** AgileTrader supports integration with various real-time data providers, allowing users to execute their strategies in live trading environments. Supported data feeds include (but are not limited to) Alpaca, IEX Cloud, and Binance.
*   **Risk Management Module:** An integrated risk management module provides tools for managing risk exposure and preventing excessive losses. Features include position sizing, stop-loss orders, and portfolio diversification.
*   **Order Execution API:** The framework provides a unified API for executing orders through various brokers. This simplifies the process of connecting to different brokers and managing order flow.
